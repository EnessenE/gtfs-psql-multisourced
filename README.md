A PostgresQL GTFS database that support GTFS data from multiple soruces.<br>
<br>
For example:
- Data is imported from data supplier 1 for country 1
- Data is imported from data supplier 2 for country 2
- Data is imported from data supplier 3 for country 1
All data should still be querable and easily reachable. And all records are labelled with where the data came from.<br>
<br>
In the future this should also keep track of merged stops from multiple suppliers (or just poor suppliers)
